# Disease Prediction Toolkit

📌 Project Overview

The Disease Detector is a machine learning project designed to predict diseases based on patient health data. The model is trained using classification techniques to analyze symptoms/medical attributes and provide predictions that can assist in healthcare diagnostics.

This project is implemented in Python with Jupyter Notebook and leverages machine learning libraries for training and evaluation.

🚀 Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning for health-related datasets Training ML models for disease prediction Model evaluation with accuracy and metrics Exporting trained model for reuse Easy-to-use interface via Jupyter Notebook

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x NumPy, Pandas → Data handling Scikit-learn → Machine learning algorithms Matplotlib, Seaborn → Visualization Joblib → Model persistence

🎯 Objectives

Learn ML fundamentals with healthcare data

Preprocess and clean dataset (handle missing values, encoding, scaling)

Train Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models

Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

Visualize results with confusion matrices and ROC curves

📂 Dataset

Source: Heart Disease UCI Dataset on Kaggle

Target column: target (1 = disease, 0 = no disease)

📊 Results

Decision Tree: Fast, interpretable, but prone to overfitting

Random Forest: Best performing model with high ROC-AUC
